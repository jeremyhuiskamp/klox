// This is sort of an obscure implementation detail test.
// We bind variable references to declarations by mapping
// the reference expressions to a number representing how far up
// the environment map we need to look.  This requires the
// expression types to be unique map keys, even when they
// have the same data.  For this, we try putting two expressions
// on the same line and make sure they can still refer to
// different depths.

// first, all formatted nicely:
fun doTheTest() {
    var x = "good";
    {
        print x; //print: good
        {
            print x; //print: good
        }
    }
}

doTheTest();

// now, crunched into one line:
fun doTheTest2() {
    var x = "good"; { print x; { print x; } }
    //print: good
    //print: good
}

doTheTest2();
